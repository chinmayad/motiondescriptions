This is the motion description dataset.

To obtain motion descriptions, we use GPT-4 API. Dataset statistics can be seen in the file Dataset Statistics of motion description dataset.pdf


This dataset is provided in conjunction with the HMDB51 dataset, UCF101 dataset, and the Kinetics-400 dataset. We encourage users to download the videos from their official pages respectively and use our motion descriptions provided in this repo.


HMDB 51 dataset
The following files, HMDB51_without_objectname.csv and hmdb51_motion_with_objectname.csv, correspond to motion descriptions without object and with object of the HMDB51 dataset, respectively. 
The file hmdb_descriptions.csv refers to the action descriptions of the HMDB51 dataset. 

UCF101 dataset
The following files, ucf101_without_objectname.csv and uc101_motion.csv, correspond to motion descriptions without object and with object of the UCF101 dataset, respectively. 
The file ucf_descriptions.csv refers to the action descriptions of the UCF101 dataset. 


Kinetics-400 dataset
The following files, kinetics400_motion_descriptions.csv, correspond to motion descriptions,  and the file Kinetics400_action_descrptions.csv, refers to the action descriptions of the Kinetics-400 dataset. 



PS: Motion descriptions and action descriptions are different. Motion descriptions describe the motion in the action, whereas action descriptions describe the action.
